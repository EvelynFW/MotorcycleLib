# MotorcycleLib

Free Modelica library for the purpose of simulation, analysis and control of bicycles and motorcycles (single-track vehicles).

## Library description

The library focuses on the modeling of virtual riders based on automatic controller design. For the single-track vehicles, several models of different complexity have been developed. To validate these models and their driving performance, virtual riders are provided. The main task of a virtual rider is to track either a roll angle profile or a pre-defined trajectory using path-preview information. Both methods are implemented and several test tracks are also included in the library.
